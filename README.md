# Z-Cookies

## What's that ??

Nowadays, a lot of websites are using cookies. They set, get or delete their cookies sometimes with jQuery, sometimes with some home made scripts...

Here is our solution : A really lightweight vanilla JS Module to handle your cookies.

It is called Z-cookies, and here is how it works :

## How does it work

_This is a module design pattern. When added to your application, nothing more than calling its methodes is required_

### Get A Cookie

#### Get a specific cookie

#### Get all the cookies as an object

### Set A Cookie

### Delete a Cookie

## Todo

* The module
  * Get
  * Set
  * Delete
* Documentation
  * Content
  * Design
